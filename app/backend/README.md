# Backend Development Guide

Atoms Cloud is enabled, use it as the backend service (provides Auth, Database, File Storage, Edge Functions, AI Capabilities).

## CRITICAL: DATABASE SETUP MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY CODE IMPLEMENTATION OR MODIFICATION

Follow These Steps in Order:

### Before Starting
- Review "Table Management Rules" section below for table operation guidelines

### For New Project Development
1. Install Dependencies (Authenticate and access the backend APIs) for frontend
   - Don't do the Row Level Security with user_id(or user.id) in the frontend. In fact, it imposes restrictions at the backend.
2. Database First (if you need to create tables)
   - Create all necessary tables using BackendManager.create_tables
     - If the table's entity is public data and unrelated to users, MUST to set `create_only=False`.
   - Generate the mock data for the necessary tables (data model) using BackendManager.insert_table_data if database table data not exists. So no need to generate mock data in the frontend.
     - Use ImageCreator.generate_images to generate images before BackendManager.insert_table_data if the mock data contains images. Check each result item: if it returns a URL (`result_item["url"]` is not empty), store that URL directly in the database; otherwise use the local path.
3. New features (if needed)
   - Generate the remaining or new features using BackendManager.create_function
4. Payment ability (if needed. After todo.md is completed)
   - Use Editor.write to create `backend/routers/payments.py` in absolute path with the following API routes which stripe package
     - MUST use `/create_payment_session` to handle payment session initialization from the frontend. CRITICAL, Don't mock data.
       - Follow the backend "Create order + PaymentSession in one step" approach when user clicks Checkout
     - MUST use `/verify_payment` to verify the payment status after a successful transaction from the frontend. CRITICAL, Don't mock data.
   - After implementing the payment routes, authorize Stripe by calling `SecretManager.builtin_intg_authz`.
5. ObjectStorage ability (if needed)
   - Use BackendManager.create_bucket to store files like images, videos and files
   - Use BackendManager.upload_objects after ImageCreator.generate_images executed, and use the absolute path as input params and filename as object key.

### For Incremental Development
1. Database Changes (if needed)
   - Check existing tables using BackendManager.get_schemas
   - Create new tables or modify existing one as needed using BackendManager.create_tables
2. New features (if needed)
   - Generate the remaining or new features using BackendManager.create_function

## Web Application with Backend Guideline

When developing a web application with backend capabilities:
- Define database table schema using json-schema (Don't use UUID; Define id as Integer if it's autoincrement.), and create new tables or modify an existing one as needed using BackendManager.create_tables.
  - json-schema will automatically generate the relevant code files and save them under `backend/models`, `backend/routes`, and `backend/services`. Don't use Editor.write to update these auto-generated files unless it is necessary.
  - The generated ORM automatically adds and maintains `created_at` and `updated_at`. Do not define, validate, or manually assign these two fields in the business json-schema or normal request payloads.
- Generate the mock data for the necessary tables (data model) using BackendManager.insert_table_data if database table data not exists.
  - If the table uses a system-managed `user_id`, omit `user_id` from the mock rows and let BackendManager.insert_table_data inject the current user's `user_id`.
- For auto-managed Datetime fields like `created_at` or `updated_at`, rely on the generated model defaults instead of manually assigning them in normal backend CRUD logic. Only provide explicit values when backfilling historical records.
- Use metagptx/web-sdk@latest to develop frontend code to fetch backend data. And no need to generate mock data in the frontend.
- When generating code, ensure that UI state updates correctly after user actions — e.g., clear the cart after payment, and update cart item count after adding a product.
- When dealing images, videos or files in photo albums, media libraries, asset management scenario, refs to ObjectStorage Integration to use endpoints and should fully implement them.
- If this request creates or modifies Python files, run `python -m py_compile` on those changed Python files before finishing. If it fails, fix the errors.

## Project Structure

```
./                              # Working dir
├── app                         # Project Folder

```

### Strict Rules
1. Do NOT modify, create, delete, or rewrite any files or subfolders under:
    - app/backend/core/**
    - app/backend/models/**
    - app/backend/main.py
    - app/backend/lambda_handler.py
2. All code generation and edits must be limited to non-protected directories only.
3. Never suggest changes, patches, diffs, or refactors that touch protected paths.

### Router Development Notes
- Routers under `routers/` are **auto-discovered** — no manual `include_router` call needed.
- All API routes MUST use prefix `/api/v1/` to be correctly proxied through Lambda.
- Read `core/config.py` `settings` for env vars: `settings.stripe_secret_key` reads `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` dynamically.

## Table Management Rules
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT CREATE ANY USER TABLES. User management is FULLY handled by Atoms Cloud's builtin user table.

## Privacy / Header UI
- By default, do NOT display the logged-in user's email/name/userId in the header/top-right area.
- Use an avatar/person icon only, unless the user explicitly asks to show user info.

## Development Guides

### Step 2: Read Frontend README
After reading this file, use `Editor.read` to also load the frontend README:
- `/workspace/app/frontend/README.md` — Frontend tech stack, component usage, and build commands.

### Step 3: Read Skill Guides

**Must-read for ALL full-stack projects** (read immediately after the frontend README):
- **Web SDK**: Frontend authorization and data model access via metagptx/web-sdk. Covers Auth flow, Entity CRUD operations (query/queryAll/get/create/update/delete), and Backend Custom API invocation using client.apiCall.invoke.
  - Document: `/workspace/app/backend/skills_docs/web_sdk.md`

**Read on demand** (use `Editor.read` to load the relevant guide based on your project requirements, before implementing that feature):
- **AI Capability**: AI text, image, video, audio generation, single-PDF analysis, and speech transcription via the aihub module. Covers frontend `client.ai` / `client.apiCall.invoke` usage, backend `AIHubService` usage, and the distinction between direct aihub endpoints and custom wrapper APIs.
  - Document: `/workspace/app/backend/skills_docs/ai_capability.md`
- **Backend Custom API**: Backend custom API development with FastAPI. Covers service logic implementation under services/, API endpoint routing under routers/, automatic routing, environment variables, and a complete Stripe payment integration example including create_payment_session and verify_payment.
  - Document: `/workspace/app/backend/skills_docs/custom_api.md`
- **Object Storage**: File and media storage integration via ObjectStorage. Covers upload/download presigned URLs, bucket management, database object_key storage pattern, and web-sdk client.storage APIs for managing files, images, and videos.
  - Document: `/workspace/app/backend/skills_docs/object_storage.md`
